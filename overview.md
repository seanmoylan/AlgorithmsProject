# MD5 Message Digest
Author: Sean Moylan

## About

In 1992 the MD5 message-digest algorithm was created to generate a unique digitial signature from a given input message (file) known as the message-digest.

MD5 is an extention of the MD4 algorithm but due to MD4 being adopted more quickly then justified

## Terminology 

word	 - Represts a 32-bit space in memory.

byte 	 - Represents a 8-bit space in memory.

x_i		 - Represents x sub i.

x^i		 - Represents x to the i-th power

(+) 		 - Addition of words (modulo-2^32 addition)

X <<< s - Circularly shifting X left by s bit positions

Bitwise Operators

    not(X)  - bit-wise complement of X
    X xor Y - bit-wise XOR of X and Y
    XY      - bit-wise AND
